## Summary
<div align='justify'> Genomics plays an emerging role in clinical and public health research. Cancer is strongly driven by genomic modifications, and wide-profiling of these modifications with new technological approaches has become a major asset for (early) diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in regard to personalised medicine. The CAN.HEAL consortium recognises that prevention, diagnosis and treatment should be approached in a concerted way for optimal benefit of patients and citizens. In the clinical arm in our project, responding to the ‘Cancer Diagnostic and Treatment for All’, we focus on applying ‘next generation sequencing’ technology and identify implementation paths to extend the application of genetic profiling of patients and tumour cells in a way that EU Cancer Centres 1°) could take advantage of national initiatives to structure omics use in patient care to allow harmonized data interpretation and facilitated treatment decisions, 2°) could better share their data allowing to apply the same or similar diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with comparable cancer profiles across the EU, thus improving equity, and 3°) take up the molecular tumour profiling biomarkers that estimate cancer predisposition to allow better counselling of family members regarding cancer risk. In the arm on ‘Genomics for Public Health’, the application of novel insights on estimating cancer risks in healthy populations by polygenic risk score analysis within population-wide interventions as well as strategies of remote genetic counselling and telegenetics will be further developed. Current genetic screening interventions such as the non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for trisomy can be direct sources for incidental findings on cancer status of the mother while also attention is given to implementing genomic profiling in paediatric cancers. Finally, we wish to set the framework for integrating and aligning the Genome of Europe biobanking initiative into public health genomics for cancer. We will further deepen the ethical and legal consents towards access to medical information and develop training tools on oncogenomics at large. Capacity building exercises will be performed in several countries. We will build on distinct use cases towards developing an integrated approach to improve access of individuals and cancer patients and survivors to prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer through personalised medicine. </div>

## Centralized Online Repository of Standard Operating Procedures

<div align='justify'>This is a framework for making genetic phenotypic and clinical data from patients useful in clinical settings, playing the role of a knowledge hub for the consortium. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for utilizing genetic, phenotypic, and clinical data from patients in clinical settings are essential to ensure consistency, accuracy, and ethical considerations in the application of this information. These SOPs serve as guidelines for healthcare professionals and researchers to effectively collect, manage, analyze, and interpret patient data for clinical decision-making. Key components of these SOPs typically include:  </div>
<br>

- Data Collection and Acquisition
- Data Integration and Management
- Analysis and Interpretation
- Clinical Decision Support
- Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement
- Ethical and Regulatory Compliance

<div align='justify'>Establishing and following these SOPs contribute to the effective translation of genetic and phenotypic data into actionable insights, ultimately improving patient care and advancing scientific understanding in clinical settings. </div>

For the needs of our consortium, three different sets of SOPs have been aquired, regarding clinical, image and omics data exchange.
- The SOPS for clinical data exchange can be found [here](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/CanHeal-NGS-SOPs/blob/main/SOPs-clinical-data-exchange.md),
- The SOPS for image data exchange can be found [here](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/CanHeal-NGS-SOPs/blob/main/SOPs-image-data-exchange.md),
- The SOPS for omics data exchange can be found [here](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/CanHeal-NGS-SOPs/blob/main/SOPs-omics-data-exchange.md).
